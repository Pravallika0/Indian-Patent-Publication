# Comprehensive System for Driver Fatigue Detection in Vehicles

## Overview
This project introduces a comprehensive system for driver fatigue detection in vehicles, leveraging sensor technology, microcontroller processing, and a multi-modal alert mechanism to enhance road safety and prevent accidents. The system detects changes in the duration of eye blinks, a key indicator of drowsiness, and responds accordingly to ensure driver alertness.

## System Components

### 1. Eye Blinking Sensor
The Eye Blinking Sensor (101) detects changes in the duration of eye blinks, indicating drowsiness.

### 2. Arduino Nano
The Arduino Nano (102) serves as the central processing unit, receiving input from the Eye Blinking Sensor and coordinating the system's response.

### 3. Motor Driver and BO Motor
The Motor Driver (103) controls the movement of the BO Motor (104) based on input received from the Arduino, initiating a response such as reducing vehicle speed to prevent accidents.

### 4. Buzzer and LED Alerts
The Buzzer (105) provides an audible alert to the driver, signaling drowsiness. The Green LED (106) acts as a visual alert, signaling the onset of drowsiness to the driver. The Red LED (107) serves as a critical visual alert, potentially indicating the need for an immediate response, such as stopping the vehicle.

## Method for Driver Fatigue Detection

1. **Eye Monitoring**: The Eye Blinking Sensor Goggles (101) constantly monitor the driver's eye.
2. **Data Processing**: The output from the Eye Blinking Sensor is transmitted to the Arduino board (102), which processes the data and makes real-time decisions based on the driver's eye behavior.
3. **Alert System**:
   - If the driver's eyes are closed for 2 seconds (201), it triggers an alert. The Buzzer (105) sounds to provide an auditory warning (203), and the Green LED (106) is activated to give a visual alert to other vehicles.
   - If the driver falls asleep and their eyes remain closed for more than 2 seconds (202), it triggers a more urgent alert. The Buzzer continues to sound for persistent audio warning, and the Red LED (107) is activated to indicate an immediate need for action. The system initiates a gradual reduction in vehicle speed (207) to prevent accidents.
4. **Visual Alerts**:
   - The Green LED provides a clear visual alert (205) to other vehicles when the driver's eyes are closed for 2 seconds.
   - The Red LED complements the warning system (206) for a more severe alert when the driver's eyes are closed for an extended period, potentially bringing the vehicle to a halt (207).
